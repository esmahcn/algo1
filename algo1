 Initialize length_counter to 0
Initialize word_counter to 1   // Assume at least one word before first space
Initialize vowel_counter to 0

Read character c

WHILE c is not '.'
    Increment length_counter by 1

    IF c is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U)
        Increment vowel_counter by 1
    END IF

    IF c is a space ' '
        Increment word_counter by 1
    END IF

    Read next character c
END WHILE

Increment length_counter by 1  // to count the final period

Output length_counter, word_counter, vowel_counter
